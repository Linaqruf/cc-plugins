Parse the user's intent from: $ARGUMENTS

Use the anipy-cli skill for all operational knowledge — CLI flags, setup procedures, player routing, and troubleshooting.

## Execution First, Fix on Failure

Do NOT check dependencies upfront. Run the anipy-cli command directly first. Only if it fails (e.g., "command not found", "PlayerError", "not found"), then diagnose and fix:

1. If `anipy-cli` not found → check `uv`, install if needed, then `uv tool install anipy-cli`
   - If uv installation fails (both `pwsh.exe` and `powershell.exe` methods fail), **STOP**. Tell the user: "uv could not be installed because PowerShell is not working correctly. Install PowerShell 7 from the Microsoft Store, restart your terminal, and try again."
2. If PlayerError → check mpv/vlc, install if needed, update config `player_path`
3. For each missing dependency, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before installing — never install silently
4. After fixing, retry the original command

## Execution

Interpret the user's natural language request and map to the appropriate anipy-cli command.

**Always prefix commands with:** `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` and **suffix with** `2>&1` to capture stderr.

**Timeouts:** Use 60s for search/play commands, 120s for downloads.

**Always use `-s` flag** for non-interactive search: `anipy-cli -s "query:episode:sub/dub"`

**Mapping examples:**
- "play frieren ep 1" → `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 anipy-cli -s "frieren:1:sub" 2>&1`
- "play steins gate episode 3 dubbed" → `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 anipy-cli -s "steins gate:3:dub" 2>&1`
- "download one piece 1-10" → `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 anipy-cli -D -s "one piece:1-10:sub" 2>&1`
- "binge spy x family 1-5 dub" → `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 anipy-cli -B -s "spy x family:1-5:dub" 2>&1`
- "show history" → read `history.json` from anipy-cli's `user_files_path` (do NOT use `-H`, it is interactive and will hang)
- "what version" → `anipy-cli --version 2>&1`
- "change player to vlc" → read and edit config.yaml player_path
- "set quality to 720p" → add `-q 720` to the next play/download command (e.g., `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 anipy-cli -q 720 -s "frieren:1:sub" 2>&1`)

**Defaults when not specified:**
- sub/dub: `sub`
- quality: `best`
- player: whatever is in config

**After search/play commands:** Check the output for the anime title that was matched. The `-s` flag auto-selects the first search result. If the matched title looks significantly different from what the user requested, inform the user which anime was found and ask if it is correct.

## Error Recovery

A command has failed if **any** of these are true:
- Non-zero exit code
- Output contains error keywords ("command not found", "PlayerError", "fatal error", "not found")
- Output is unexpectedly empty (search/play produced no stream URL or meaningful content)
- For downloads: file was not created or is zero bytes

When a failure is detected (max 2 retries before giving up):
1. Read the error message from combined stdout+stderr
2. Consult the anipy-cli skill's troubleshooting section
3. Attempt to fix (e.g., update config, install missing dep)
4. Retry the original command
5. If still failing after retries, explain the full error chain to the user

**Ignore these non-fatal messages:**
- `UserWarning: color, on_color and attrs are not supported` — yaspin TTY warning
- `SyntaxWarning: 'return' in a 'finally' block` — upstream code issue
- `EOFError: EOF when reading a line` — only non-fatal if output also contains a stream URL or "Playing" indication. If EOFError is the only output or appears before any stream/play activity, treat it as a real failure (command likely ran in interactive mode without `-s`)
- Raw ANSI codes like `[34m`, `[0m` — display artifacts
