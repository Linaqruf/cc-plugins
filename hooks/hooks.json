The current directory does NOT appear to have a project_spec.md (you can check by looking at the working directory context)\n2. The user is not already asking for help with planning or specs\n\nThen output ONLY this message (nothing else):\n\nConsider running `/spec` first to plan your project and create a specification document.\n\nIf the conditions are not met, output nothing (empty response)."
